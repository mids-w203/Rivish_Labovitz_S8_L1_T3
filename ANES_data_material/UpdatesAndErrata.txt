Current Dataset Release: March 24, 2021 version
April 22, 2021
In the processing of the 2020 Time Series post-election data, a potential issue has been detected involving the variables V202498x â€“ V202504. 
For that reason, most of the variables from this submodule (IDENT) were coded to -2 with our intent being to research the issue and include 
those variables in the full release of the 2020 Time Series data. However, it was pointed out that the variable V202504 (How important is being 
American to your identity?) was not included in that set of recodes and contains valid data. The data, somewhat predictably, look off. We are 
in the process of trying to fully resolve the issues with all of the variables from this submodule and will re-release them as soon as possible.
